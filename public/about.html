<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born to First Nation (Algonquin) parents in Nothern Quebec in a small french village.  
  Although it was a french village, the town was bilingual because of tourism
  Many english speaking tourist would come for fishing and hunting.

<p>Photography has been a passion of mine for more than 10 years now.  Focussing mainly in Landscaping.
  Recently I've begun using a drone.  Quite cool!

<p>Although Photography is my favourite hobby, I also enjoy listening to music. 
  More specifically music from the 60's and 70's.  Those were the good ole days.
